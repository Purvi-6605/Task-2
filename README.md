# Task-2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Overview**
This repository contains the solution for Task 2 of the Elevate AI & ML Internship. The goal of this task was to explore the dataset using statistical methods and data visualizations to uncover patterns, relationships, trends, and anomalies that could inform future machine learning tasks.

**Dataset**
The Titanic dataset was used for this task. It includes demographic and travel-related data for Titanic passengers, along with their survival outcome.

üõ†Ô∏è **Tools and Libraries Used**
Python 3.x

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Plotly (for interactive visualizations)

‚úÖ **Task Steps**
1. Import and Inspect the Dataset:
Loaded the dataset using Pandas and reviewed its structure, data types, and summary statistics.

Identified missing values and basic distributions.

2. Generate Summary Statistics:
Computed key statistics including mean, median, and standard deviation.

Reviewed column-wise distributions and count summaries.

3. Visualize Data Distributions:
Created histograms to understand the distribution of numerical features.

Used boxplots to detect outliers and visualize spread.

4. Analyze Feature Relationships:
Generated correlation heatmaps to find relationships between numeric features.

Created pairplots to visualize joint distributions.

Built interactive visualizations using Plotly for deeper exploration.

5. Identify Patterns and Outliers:
Detected skewed features, trends, and potential data issues (e.g., extreme values).

Inferred possible insights from visual patterns and correlations.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è** How to Run**
Ensure required libraries are installed:
pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly.

Replace "your_dataset.csv" with your actual dataset path in the script.

Run the Python script or Jupyter notebook to perform EDA and generate visualizations.

üí°** What I Learned**
How to summarize data using descriptive statistics.

Visual techniques to identify outliers, trends, and correlations.

The role of data visualization in the EDA phase of machine learning.

The value of interactive plots in understanding multi-dimensional data.
